# ParaScopes: Residual Stream Decoders for Language Models

This repository contains the code for the ParaScopes project. The files are here
but not very organized. I will try to clean it up soon.

Current naming:

- `utils_*` = baseline code imported into other files
- `01_*` = generating the text dataset
- `02_*` = getting activations and vectors for training
- `03_*` = training the probes (if trainable)
- `04_*` = using probes to generate comparison text
- `05_*` = getting metrics comparing the texts
- `06_*` = making plots
